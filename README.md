## ABOUT
This project involved recreating the well-known C library function, printf. This provided a valuable learning opportunity in variadic arguments and structures, particularly if we intend to incorporate additional flags into our implementation of print.

- [Subject](https://github.com/Mealiclay01/Ft_Printf/blob/b614cb1e603d97a68007a151d4edda7c04b74e31/ft_printf_subject.pdf) `PDF`

## HOW TO USE
#### 1º - Clone the repository
```git
git clone git@github.com:Mealiclay01/Ft_Printf.git
```

#### 2º - Enter the project folder and run `make`
```bash
cd Ft_Printf/Ft_Printf
make
```

#### 3º - To use in your code, include the header
```c
#include "ft_printf.h"
```

#### MAKEFILE RULES

`make` or `make all` - Compile ft_printf files.

`make clean` - Delete all .o (object files) files.

`make fclean` - Delete all .o (object files) and .a (executable) files.

`make re` - Use rules `fclean` + `all`.

## MANDATORY
> This ft_printf function supports several format specifiers, described below:
- [x] `%c` - Print a single character;
- [x] `%s` - Print a string;
- [x] `%p` - Print void * pointer argument in hexadecimal format;
- [x] `%d` - Print a decimal (base 10) number;
- [x] `%i` - Print an integer in base 10;
- [x] `%u` - Prints an unsigned decimal (base 10) number;
- [x] `%x` - Print a number in hexadecimal (base 16) lowercase format;
- [x] `%X` - Print a number in hexadecimal (base 16) uppercase format;
- [x] `%%` - Print a percentage sign;

## BONUS
- [ ] Manage any combination of the following flags: `-O` and the field minimum width under all conversions;
- [ ] Manage all the following flags: `#` ` ` `+`;

## NORMINETTE
> At 42 School, it is expected that almost every project is written following the Norm, which is the coding standard of the school.

```
- No for, do...while, switch, case, goto, ternary operators, or variable-length arrays allowed;
- Each function must be a maximum of 25 lines, not counting the function's curly brackets;
- Each line must be at most 80 columns wide, with comments included;
- A function can take 4 named parameters maximum;
- No assigns and declarations in the same line (unless static);
- You can't declare more than 5 variables per function;
- ...
